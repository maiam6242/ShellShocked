# Shell Shocked: Creating a UNIX Shell in C

## HK Rho and Maia Materman

### Project Goals

Through this project, we would like to learn how to create a simple, functional UNIX shell in C. As for the minimum viable product, we vision our shell to run 5 basic commands: **cd**, **ls**, **mkdir**, **rm**, and **man**. By the end of working on this project, we want to have a good understanding of how shells work. 

If we go beyond our minimum viable product, we would like to implement more commands and deal more with the edge cases and options associated with each command we have created. We also would like to try to implement a text editor as a major stretch goal.
### Learning Goals

We would like to learn more about how to write C in a "real world context" and practice with the C that we've learned. We'd also like to better learn and understand UNIX commands, so that we can get better at using them! We are looking forward to getting more comfortable with how operating systems work at a pretty low level.

### Next Steps

We have outlined three major tasks for this week: 

1. Find a convenient time to meet outside of class  
    * Definition of Done: Have a set meeting time on both of our calendars (iCal encouraged, but not necessary!)
2. Review resources and tutorials to get a better sense of how to create a shell  
    * Definition of Done: Have a solid understanding of how to begin designing and creating our project and the basic functionality of the shell
3. Pair program to create the **ls** command  
    * Definition of Done: Show that it is able to execute the command on the shell
4. Begin working on the **cd** command  
    * Definition of Done: Minimum demonstration could include pseudocode
    
For all the next steps mentioned above, both teammates will be working together on the tasks.
